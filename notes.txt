HTML: So far I have learned a bunch about HTML in this class, which is interesting because I felt like we did a ton with HTML in IS201, but we are learning different things now and at a different pace that make it clearer and more cohesive how to code websites and learning how actual things work within the code. I have learned the difference it makes to label different sections, and the way that I can actually alter those sections with CSS specifically. I have also learned about the Go Live function that we use, that makes it fun to code and look at my website at the same time.

CSS: I started learning CSS in IS201, but we learned a bunch more about line spacing, fonts, colors, and images (borders and rounded corners) that can make my website look a lot better than it did in IS201. I was excited to learn about the ways that CSS can alter perfectly normal looking websites into interesting, visually stunning websites. I look forward to learning more complex ideas with it as well.

Git: I knew nothing about Git before this course, besides that we would push code to Git and it would allow me to pull and commit in GitHub. I learned that they are entirely different services, but GitHub allows me to push and pull from my Git on my computer. I have also learned about using Git in my terminal to potentially make my source control even better and easier, and this allows me to understand when and how to commit my changes.
