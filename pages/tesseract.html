        <h2>What is the Tesseract?</h2>
        <p>
            The tesseract is a four-dimensional hypercube that is a key plot element in the movie Interstellar. It is a cube that is unfolded into four dimensions, allowing Cooper to interact with his daughter Murph at different points in time. The tesseract is a representation of the fifth dimension, which is time. The tesseract is a complex structure that is difficult to understand, but it plays a crucial role in the movie's plot.

            This is one of the main plot twists of the entire movie. It points back to the beginning of the movie, where we see Cooper's daughter Murph begging Cooper to not go to space, and an item falls from the shelf. It is later revealed in this scene that it was Cooper manipulating time and space through the Tesseract.
